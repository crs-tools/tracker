CRS Ticket Tracker
==================

The Ticket Tracker is a web platform tracking process of video recording and
ingest sources and video encoding progress. It guides users through manual processes like editing and checking and provides an API for [scripts](https://github.com/crs-tools/crs-scripts) doing post processing and encoding.
